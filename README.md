# RUGVED-IGVC

##### 1.Taken ROI and HSV value of video
##### 2.Split HSV into hue and saturation
##### 3.Applied individual thresholding for hue and saturation
##### 4.Added both thresholds arithmetically 
##### 5.Applied a third thresholded in order to remove noise
##### 6.Applied canny and HoughP

Used this method as it helped reduce noise without needing to apply any blurring or morphological functions.
The major noise is coming from the cones which i havent removed and the stones on the ground.
